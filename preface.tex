Pairing-based cryptography is a relatively young research area that
revolves around a particular family of functions known as \emph{pairings} or
\emph{bilinear maps}, whose remarkable properties allow the construction of
novel cryptosystems that are otherwise difficult or impossible to assemble
using standard primitives.

We first provide an abstract definition of a cryptographic pairing and use it
to build a simple yet versatile signature scheme. Next we examine how a pairing
can be implemented in practice. The only known mathematical setting where
suitable pairings exist are groups on certain families of curves. We focus on
the simplest and most well-understood case: elliptic curves.

We discuss methods for finding curves that yield cryptographic pairings, and
outline various optimizations that can be applied. We shall see that
pairing-based cryptosystems are practical and compare well against traditional
cryptosystems.

We hope this will help a suitably experienced programmer implement
pairing-based cryptography. While not comprehensive, the information contained
herein should be enough to allow one to build practical pairing-based
applications from scratch. Notably absent are the characteristic 3 case,
pairings where the subgroup size is necessarily significantly smaller than the
field size, and hyperelliptic curves.

This text is intended to be self-contained. Aside from arithmetic at the lowest
level, algorithms unlikely to be found in a basic course in number theory or
cryptography are quoted here, enabling the reader to implement pairings without
referring to any other sources. We assume the reader has some familiarity with
abstract algebra. On the other hand, we introduce enough elliptic curve theory
for cryptographic purposes.
