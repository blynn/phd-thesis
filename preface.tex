Pairing-based cryptography is a relatively young area of cryptography that
revolves around a particular family of functions informally called
\emph{pairings} or \emph{bilinear maps}, whose remarkable properties allow the
construction of novel cryptosystems that are otherwise difficult or impossible
to assemble using standard primitives.

We first provide an abstract definition of a cryptographic pairing and use it
to build a simple yet versatile signature scheme. Next we examine how a pairing
can be implemented in practice. The only known mathematical setting where
suitable pairings exist are groups on certain families of curves. We focus on
the simplest and most well-understood case: elliptic curves.

We discuss methods for finding curves that yield cryptographic pairings, and
outline various optimizations that can be applied. We shall see that
pairing-based cryptosystems are quite practical and compare well against
traditional cryptosystems.

We hope this work will be a useful guide to implementing pairing-based
cryptography to a programmer who has experience with conventional
cryptosystems. While not comprehensive, the information contained herein should
be enough to allow one to build practical pairing-based applications from
scratch. Notably absent are in-depth discussion of the characteristic 3 case,
pairings where the subgroup size is necessarily significantly smaller than the
field size, and hyperelliptic curves,

This text is intended to be self-contained. Aside from arithmetic at the lowest
level, algorithms unlikely to be found in a basic course in number theory or
cryptography are quoted here, enabling the reader to implement pairings without
referring to any other sources.

Some background is required by the reader as we do not review basic abstract
algebra. On the other hand, we introduce enough elliptic curve theory for
cryptographic purposes.
