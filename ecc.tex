\chapter {Elliptic Curves}
We review basic facts about elliptic curves.
Aside from the problem of generating suitable elliptic curves,
we will cover enough theory to replace finite fields with
elliptic curves in cryptosystems based on cyclic groups, except
for the issue of finding suitable curves.
We discuss pairings in the following chapter, and describe algorithms
to find suitable curves in the chapter after that.

Let $\Fq$ be a field for some prime $q > 3$.
Unless otherwise specified we shall always
define curves over a field of prime order and of characteristic greater
than three.
Elliptic curves can be implemented over fields of characteristic 2 and 3
and enjoy many optimizations,
but suffer from specialized discrete log attacks and should generally
be avoided.

An elliptic curve $E$ over such a field $\Fq$ is an equation of the form
\[ E: Y^2 = X^3 + a X + b \]
where $a, b \in \Fq$.
Let $\Delta = 4 a^3 + 27b^2$ (the discriminant of the cubic in $x$). Then
$E$ is \emph{singular} if $\Delta = 0$ (so the cubic has distinct solutions),
and \emph{nonsingular} otherwise.

Unless otherwise stated we always consider nonsingular elliptic curves.
(Later we will encounter \emph{supersingular} curves, a particular
flavour of nonsingular curves and are \emph{not} singular despite their
name.
The antonym of supersingular is \emph{ordinary} or \emph{nonsupersingular}.)

For any field $\Fqk$ define $E(\Fqk)$ (or $E/\Fqk$)
to be the set of all solutions
of $E$ over $\Fqk$, called the \emph{finite points}
along with a special point denoted $O$,
that is called the \emph{point at infinity}. We write $\#E(\Fqk)$ 
or $|E(\Fqk)|$ for
the number of elements of $E(\Fqk)$.

Although irrelevant, the reader may be curious about the point at infinity.
Briefly, by considering the equation in
projective coordinates one can show that $O = (0,1,0)$ is always a unique
infinite solution to the equation. Intuitively,
the point $O$ can be thought of as the point where all lines
parallel to the Y-axis meet.

We quote two well-known theorems from the theory of elliptic curves.

\begin{theorem}
[Hasse] Let $t = q^k + 1 - \#E(\Fqk)$.
Then $|t| \le 2\sqrt{q^k}$.
\end{theorem}

Thus the number of points on an elliptic curve in a given field
is on the same order as the size of the field.
The quantity $t$ is called the \emph{trace of Frobenius}.

\begin{theorem}
[Weil] Let $t = q + 1 - \#E(\Fq)$
where $q$ is a prime power.
Factor the polynomial $x^2 - t x + q$ as $(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)$ over
$\mathbb{C}[x]$.
Then
\[ \#E(\Fqk) = q^k + 1 - (\alpha^k + \beta^k) .\]
\end{theorem}

This last theorem is more practical in the following form. Let $t_0 = 2$,
Let $t_1 = q + 1 - \#E(\Fq)$.
Define $t_n$ recursively by
\[ t_n = t_1 t_{n-1} - q t_{n-2} .\]
Then $\#E(\Fqk) = q^k + 1 - t_k$.

For example, consider the curve E\cite{bk} given by
\[ Y^2 = X^3 + X + 6 \]
over $\F_{19}$. There are 18 points
\[
\begin{array}{llllll}
(0,5), & (4,6), & (2,4), & (3,6), & (14,3), & (12,13), \\
(18,2), & (10,3), & (6,0), & (10,16), & (18, 17), & (12,6), \\
(14,16), & (3,13), & (2,15), & (4,13), & (0,14), & O
\end{array}
\]
thus the trace of Frobenius $t = 2$.

Over $\F_{{19}^2}$, we have
\[
\#E(\F_{{19}^2}) = 19^2 + 1 - t_2
\]
where $t_2 = 2\cdot 2 - 19 \cdot 2 = -34$, thus
$\#E(\F_{{19}^2}) = 396$.

\section {Twisting Curves}

Let $E$ be an elliptic curve $Y^2 = X^3 + a X + b$ in $\Fq$ where
$q$ is a prime power.
Let $v$ be a quadratic nonresidue in $\Fq$.
Consider
the curve $E'$ given by $Y^2 = X^3 + a v^2 X + v^3 b$,
which we call the (quadratic) \emph{twist} of the curve $E$.

\begin{theorem}
Let $t = q + 1 - \#E(\Fq)$. Then $\#E'(\Fq) = q + 1 + t$.
\end{theorem}

The proof is straightforward.
Let $g(X) = X^3 + a X + b$, and $h(X) = X^3 + a v^2 X + v^3 b$.
Note $h(X) = v^3 g(Xv^{-1})$.

There are three cases.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
If $g(xv^{-1}) = 0$ then $v^3g(xv^{-1}) = h(x) = 0$ thus
$Y = 0$ is the unique solution to both the
equations $Y^2 = g(xv^{-1})$ and $Y^2 = h(x)$.
\item
If $g(xv^{-1})$ is a quadratic residue then $Y^2 = g(xv^{-1})$
has exactly two solutions,
and $Y^2 = v^3 g(xv^{-1}) = h(x)$ has no solutions (since $v^3$
is a quadratic nonresidue).
\item
If $g(xv^{-1})$ is a quadratic nonresidue then the situation is reversed:
$Y^2 = g(xv^{-1})$ has no solutions and
and $Y^2 = h(x)$ has exactly two solutions.
\end{enumerate}

As $x$ runs through all the elements of $\Fq$, so does $xv^{-1}$,
and we see that total number of solutions to either equation $E$ and $E'$
over $\Fq$ is $2q$.
Since $O$ is always a solution of any elliptic curve we have
$\#E(\Fq) + \#E(\Fq) = 2q + 2$, proving the theorem.

On the other hand if $v$ is a quadratic residue then $v = c^2$ for some
$c \in \Fq$. Then we have a map $\Psi : E'(\Fq) \rightarrow E(\Fq)$
given by

\[ \Psi(x,y) = (c^2 x,c^3 y) \]

hence in some sense $E$ and $E'$ are the same curve, so the choice of
quadratic nonresidue $v$ does not matter as they all lead to the same twist.

Note a quadratic
nonresidue $v$ becomes a quadratic residue in $\F_{q^2}$ (that is, we
can find a square root $c$ of $v$)
and we have a map between
$E'(\F_{q^2})$ and $E(\F_{q^2})$. Roughly speaking, curves that are twists
of each other become the same curve when considered in a quadratic extension
of the field they are defined in.

For example, since $2$ is a quadratic nonresidue in $\F_{19}$,
the curve $E : Y^2 = X^3 + X + 6$ (over $\F_{19}$) has the
twist $E': Y^2 = X^3 + 4 X + 10$, and $E'(\F_{19})$ contains 22 points.

In $\F_{19^2}$, both $E$ and $E'$ contain 396 points, and we can map
points of $E'$ to points of $E$ via $(x,y) \rightarrow (2 x, 2\sqrt{2} y)$.

We can use quadratic residues to transform the equation of a given elliptic
curve $E$ into a form that allows certain optimizations.
It turns out that ideally we would like $a = 0$ to reduce the amount of
operations needed to compute on an elliptic curve, but for a general curve
this an impossible transformation. We shall see a reasonable alternative
is $a = -3$.

Then from above, a curve $Y^2 = X^3 + aX + b$ can be transformed into
one of the form $Y^2 = X^3 - 3X + b'$ if we can find $c\in \Fq$
satisfying $a c^4 = -3$.

This is not always possible, so a compromise is to have
$a = 1$ or $a = -3 d^2$ for some small integer $d$
(or $d$ of low Hamming weight), which can be achieved in a similar manner.

\section {The Chord-Tangent Law of Composition}

TODO: pictures

We define an operation $+$ on $E(\Fqk)$.
Let $P = (a,b), Q = (c,d) \in E(\Fqk)$ be finite points.

If $P \ne Q$, then it is not hard to show that if $a \ne c$
then the line through $P$ and $Q$ must intersect $E$ at another point
$(x,y)$ where $x, y\in \Fqk$. Note that $(x,-y)$ also is a solution of $E$.
Define $P + Q = (x, -y)$ for $a \ne c$.
If $a = c$ (in which case we must have $b = -d$),
then define $P + Q = O$.

Now suppose $Q = P$. In this case, consider the tangent line going through
$P$. It turns out it must intersect $E$ at another point $(x,y)$ where
$x,y\in\Fqk$ unless $b = 0$. Define $P + P = (x, -y)$ for $b \ne 0$.
For $b = 0$ define $P + P = O$.

Lastly define $P + O = P$, $O + O = O$.

This operation turns $E(\Fqk)$ into a group.
The point $O$ is the identity, and the inverse
of a point $P = (x,y)$ is the point $-P = (x,-y)$.

As usual, for an integer $n$ define $0 P = O$, $1 P = P$,
$n P = (n-1)P + P$ for $n > 1$ and $n P = -(-n)P$ for $n < 0$.

Recall the previous chapter used mulitplicative group notation to emphasize
the connection
between discrete log cryptosystems and pairing-based cryptosystems:
we are using elliptic curve groups where one would use
the multiplicative group of a finite field.

Mathematicians use additive group notation for the elliptic curve group
(since the group is Abelian), and we will adhere to this convention in this
section.

For the curve $Y^2 = X^3 + X + 6$ over $\F_{19}$,
it can be verified for instance that
$(0, 5) + (0, 5) = (4, 6)$,
and $(0, 5) + (2, 15) = (4, 13)$.

\section {Explicit Formulas}

Let $E: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$ be an elliptic curve over $\Fqk$. Let
$P_1, P_2 \in E(\Fqk)$ and suppose
we wish to find $P_3 = P_1 + P_2$.
Note the case where at least one of $P_1, P_2$ is $O$ is trivial,
so assume both $P_1$ and $P_2$ are finite.
Then write $P_1 = (x_1, y_1), P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$.

If $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 = -y_2$
then the line $V$ through $P_1$ and $P_2$ is vertical and
can be given by
\[ V : X - x_1 = 0  . \]
In this case $P_3 = O$ (and $P_1 = -P_2$).

Otherwise $P_3$ also must be finite, hence write $P_3 = (x_3, y_3)$.
We have two cases. If $P_1 = P_2$ then the tangent line $T$ at
$P_1$
has slope
\[\lambda =
\left[ \frac{\partial E / \partial X}{\partial E/ \partial Y} \right]_{(x_1,y_1)}
= \frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1} . \]
and if $P_1 \ne P_2$ then the line $L$ through $P_1$ and $P_2$ has slope
\[ \lambda = (y_2 - y_1)/(x_2 - x_1) . \]

If we set $\mu = y_1 - \lambda x_1$ then
the equation of $L$ or $T$ is given by:

\[ L, T :  Y - (\lambda X + \mu) = 0 \]

We can find the $x$-coordinate of the other point of intersection $(x_3, -y_3)$
by substituting $Y = \lambda X + \mu$ into $E$. We find
\[ E(X, \lambda X+\mu) = X^3 - \lambda^2 X^2 + a_1 X + a_0 = 0 \]
for some $a_1, a_0 \in \Fqk$, thus the sum of the roots
$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = \lambda^2$.

This allows us to compute $x_3, y_3$. Explicitly we have for $P_1 \ne P_2$:

\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\lambda &\leftarrow& (y_2 - y_1)/(x_2 - x_1) \\
x_3 &\leftarrow& \lambda^2 - x_1 - x_2 \\
y_3 &\leftarrow& (x_1 - x_3) \lambda - y_1
\end{array}
\]
and for $P_1 = P_2$:
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\lambda &\leftarrow& (3x_1^2 + a)/(2y_1) \\
x_3 &\leftarrow& \lambda^2 - 2x_1 \\
y_3 &\leftarrow& (x_1 - x_3) \lambda - y_1
\end{array}
\]
The most expensive step is the division in the computation of
$\lambda$.

The expressions for the lines $L,T,V$ will be used later in the computation
of a pairing.

\section {Elliptic Curve Cryptography}

Having described an Abelian group operation on points on an elliptic curve,
we can almost see how elliptic curves may be used in cryptography.
Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over a field $K$.

Firstly, we can generate random points on $E$:
after generating a random $x \in K$, we can attempt to solve $E$ for $y$ by
using any finite field square root algorithm which we discuss below.
If no solution exists, simply pick a new random $x$.

Hashing to a point in $E$ is similar. The input is hashed to some
$x \in K$, and then a corresponding $y$ is sought. On failure,
a new $x$-coordinate is deterministically generated from $x$, and again
we attempt to solve $E$ for $y$. Repeating this process as many times as
necessary eventually yields a valid point $(x,y) \in E(K)$.

Let $F$ be a finite field.
The above formulas describe how to compute inverses and sums of
points. Thus it seems natural to replace elements of $F^*$
with elements of $E(K)$, and perform
point addition instead of modular multiplication.

The elliptic curve
equivalent of exponentiation is called
\emph{point multiplication}: $a P$ represents
adding $P$ to itself $a$ times just as $g^a$ represents $g$ multiplied
by itself $a$ times in finite fields.
Point multiplication can be performed efficiently via carefully
chosen point
additions, in a process that mirrors the repeated squaring technique
for exponentiation in finite fields.

Recall that cryptographic schemes in $F^*$ often operate
within a subgroup $G$ of a particular order $r$,
so elements chosen at random and hashed to must have
order $r$, or a factor of $r$. But an element of $F^*$
in general does not have the desired order.
Thus after choosing or hashing to some element $x \in F^*$,
to obtain an element of a suitable order one simply exponentiates $x$
by $n / r$ where $n = \#F^*$.

Similarly, the construction a point of order $r$ (or a factor of $r$)
from some given point $P \in E(K)$ is accomplished by multiplying $P$ by
$n / r$ where $n = \#E(K)$.

Assume for now that we know $n = \#E(K)$. Then from group theory (a
Sylow theorem), for any prime $r$ dividing $n$,
there exists a point $P \in E(K)$ of order $r$.

Then if $r^2$ does not divide $n$ then there is exactly one
subgroup $G$ of $E(K)$ of order $r$.

This suggests the following procedure for implementing any cryptographic
scheme based on cyclic groups of prime order:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Choose any curve $E(K)$ and somehow work out $n = \#E(K)$.
\item
Find a prime $r$ dividing $n$, such that $r^2 \nmid n$.
We shall work in the unique cyclic subgroup of points $G \subset E(K)$
of order $r$.
\item
When a random group element of $G$ is required, first choose a random point
of $E(K)$ and then multiply by $n / r$. Similarly, when hashing to
a point of $G$, first hash to a point in $E(K)$ and then mulitply by
$n / r$.
\item
Other operations are straightforward: every time a group
operation is required, we perform a point addition. To find an inverse
of a group element, we negate the $y$-coordinate of a point. When
an exponentiation is called for we carry out a point multiplication
\end{enumerate}

TODO: table? diagram?

But how do we compute $\#E(K)$? Fast algorithms exist for this~\cite{bss}
but it turns out that if a pairing is desired, we must seek out
elliptic curves whose orders satisfy various conditions.
As a result,
instead of choosing a curve first and counting the number of points $n$ and
hoping for a large prime factor $r$ of $n$,
we must use certain families of curves where the size of the group
is known in advance and has certain properties. We shall explore this
more in a later chapter.

For now, we will present one case where $\#E(K)$ is always easy to work out
and furthermore $E(K)$ is always cyclic.

\section {Singular Elliptic Curves}

Using singular elliptic curves
is equivalent to conventional cryptography.
It can be shown that the set $E_{ns}$ nonsingular points (all but
one) of a singular elliptic curve over a field $K$
also form a group under the chord-tangent law,
and either $E_{ns} \cong K^*$ or $E_{ns} \cong K^+$ \cite{prop2.5silverman}.
Furthermore these isomorphisms are efficiently computable in either
direction.
(The latter case is not useful as discrete log is easy in $K^+$.)

For example, consider the curve
\[ E : y^2 = x^3 + x^2 \]
This has a singular point at $(0,0)$. Then the other solutions to
this curve (including the point at infinity) form a group
$E_{ns}(\Fqk)$ for any finite field $\Fqk$.

Furthermore, there is an isomorphism $E_{ns}(\Fqk) \rightarrow \Fqk^*$
given by
\[ (x,y) \mapsto \frac{y-x}{y+x} \]
(and maps $O$ to $1$)
which is efficienty computable in either direction.
A little algebra
shows the reverse map is
\[ z \mapsto \left( x', \frac{1+z}{1-z} x' \right) \]
where $x' = 4z/(1-z)^2$ for $z \ne 1$, and $1 \mapsto O$.

This example has little practical value as point additions are slower than
modular multiplications and points, having two coordinates, take twice as
much storage as an element of a finite field. However, it does suggest
that cryptography in finite fields can be viewed as a special
case of elliptic curve cryptography, and strictly speaking,
those that complain that elliptic curve cryptography is controversial,
too experimental and untested must qualify
their remarks by making exceptions for singular curves!

We note that if an efficiently bilinear nondegenerate pairing could be found
for singular curves then the Decisional Diffie-Hellman problem could be broken
in finite fields.

\section {Generating Random Points}

Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over a field $K$.
To generate a random point, first generate $x \in K$ randomly.
Next, we solve $E : Y^2 = X^3 + a X + b$ for $Y$.
Let $g(X) = x^3 + a X + b$. Then
we must find a square root of $g(x)$.

For a field of prime order one can use the Tonelli-Shanks algorithm
to compute square roots. For a general finite field,
one must use a more complex algorithm. Perhaps the simplest of these
Legendre's method which can be viewed as a special
case of the Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm for factoring polynomials that
will be described in a later chapter.

TODO: quote Tonelli-Shanks for easy reference

Faster algorithms exist, though sometimes require precomputation~\cite{djb}.

Approximately half the time no square root exists.
In the case that $K$ has prime order,
one can compute the Legendre symbol before attempting to square root $g(x)$.
More generally it can be checked that $X^2 - g(x)$ is reducible. Alternatively,
one can proceed with a square root algorithm and square the result and
compare with $g(x)$.

In any event, if $g(x)$ is not a square then simply start again and
chose another random $x \in K$. Eventually a suitable $x$ will be found.
Once found, a coin is flipped that decides which of the square roots will
be the $y$-coordinate.

It is impossible to choose the point at infinity with this method,
which is usually desirable. Clearly, if one wishes to be able to pick
the point at infinity, one could simply add a step before choosing $x$:
with $1/n$ probability choose $O$ otherwise proceed normally, where
$n = \#E(K)$.

\section {Representing Points}

Instead of using a pair of numbers to represent a point,
we can use Jacobian projective coordinates: the triplet
$(x,y,z)$ represents the point $(x/z^2, y/z^3)$.

Then to double the point $(x,y,z)$, we compute $(x_3, y_3, z_3)$ by:

\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\lambda_1 & \leftarrow & 3x^2 + a z^4 \\
z_3 & \leftarrow & 2yz \\
\lambda_2 & \leftarrow & 4xy^2 \\
x_3 & \leftarrow & \lambda_2^2 - 2 \lambda_2 \\
\lambda_3 & \leftarrow & 8 y^4 \\
y_3 & \leftarrow & \lambda_1(\lambda_2 - x_3) - \lambda_3
\end{array}
\]

We see the computation of $3x^2 + a z^4$ in general costs $3S + 1M$
where $M$ and $S$ denote the time required for a multiplication and
a squaring respectively. (We consider multiplication by
a small constant to be negligible.)

For $a=0$ the cost is only $1S$.

For small $a$ or fairly small $a$ with low Hamming weight the cost is $3S$.

For $a=-3$ we may compute $\lambda_1 = 3(x+z^2)(x-z^2)$ which costs
$1M + 1S$.

For $a = -3 d^2$ where $d$ is small or fairly small with low Hamming weight,
we may compute $\lambda_1 = 3(x+dz^2)(x-dz^2)$ which also costs $1M + 1S$.
By transforming the curve using the procedure mentioned in the section on
twist curves (i.e. twisting curves, but using quadratic residues instead
of nonresidues so that the resulting curve is isomorphic to the original),
we can always obtain an $a$ that is faster than the general case.

TODO: quote them instead for handy reference:
We omit the formulas for projective point addition, and for adding
an affine point to a projective point, referring the reader instead
to Blake et al. or Cohen et al. \cite{stuff}.

The latter investigate other kinds of projective coordinates, where point
doubling or multiplication is even faster.

\section {Point Compression}

We can optimize point representations for space instead of time,
useful for transmission and storage.
Given $x$, we can solve $Y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$ for $Y$, thus
a point $(x,y)$ can be represented by $x$ along with a single bit indicating
which solution of $y$ to take. We discuss how to find square roots later.

Alternatively, for some cases we can simply use $x$ alone. For example,
suppose Alice needs to send Bob a point in some cryptosystem. She sends
Bob $x$, who guesses the solution $y$. Bob attempts to proceed normally.
If the protocol fails (e.g. the signature does not verify) then Bob tries
$-y$ and tries again. This does not cost much more since the solutions are
related by negation, and we will see that in some pairing-based systems
one can check both possibilities at the same time.

(Of course we can take this principle further. Alice can
omit $k$ bits of $x$, and leave Bob to try all $2^k$ possibilities.)

\section {Point Multiplication}

Point multiplication is the elliptic curve equivalent of modular
exponentiation, thus optimizations that apply to one often apply to the other.

One difference is that group inversion is much cheaper in elliptic curves:
one simply negates the $y$-coordinate, an operation that is essentially free,
whereas in finite fields one must spend time running the extended
Euclidean algorithm.

This allows one to use non-adjacent forms (or signed windows), which
TODO: refer to bss, handbook
Sliding Windows.

If it is known in advance that a particular point $P$ will feature in
several point mulitplications, preprocessing can be employed, namely
multiples of $P$ used often in the exponentiation routine
are computed and stored.

When computing expressions
of the form $a P + b Q$ (the equivalent of $g^x h^y$ in
finite fields), rather than computing $a P$ and $b Q$ separately
and adding the results, one can use
a multiexponentiation trick to roughly halve the number of point doublings
(if $a$ and $b$ are about the same length).
In its simplest form, $P + Q$ is precomputed and stored,
then a double-and-add algorithm is used to compute the
final result. Instead of describing the algorithm in full, we present
and example:

To compute $12 P + 7 Q$ one precomputes $P + Q$, then:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
$R \leftarrow P$
\item
$R \leftarrow 2R$
\item
$R \leftarrow R + (P + Q)$
\item
$R \leftarrow 2R$
\item
$R \leftarrow R + Q$
\item
$R \leftarrow 2R$
\item
$R \leftarrow R + Q$
\end{enumerate}

Multiexponentiation can
be generalized to computing any expression of the form
$a_1 P_1 + ... + a_t P_t$. Multiexponentiation can also be combined with
sliding window techniques.
One drawback is the amount of precomputation needed,
which worsens as $t$ increases, and also as the size of the sliding window
is increased in which case one must store $m P + n Q$ for several $m, n$.
