\chapter{Miscellaneous Optimizations}

We describe various
optimizations unrelated to pairings, or elliptic curves in general.

\section{Dedicated Squaring}

For each field, ring or group, dedicated squaring or doubling routines
can be helpful. The savings accrued during exponentiations can be significant.

\section{Field Extensions}

When possible, a degree two field extension of a field $\mathbb{F}_q$
should be implemented as $\mathbb{F}_q[i]$ where $i$ is a square root of $-1$.
This can be done if and only if $q = 3 \pmod{4}$.

We have
\[ (a + i b)^2 = (a - b)(a + b) + i (2 a b) \]
and
\[ (a + i b)(c + i d) = (ac - bd) + i[(a + b)(c + d) - ac - bd] \]

More generally, for low degree extensions (e.g. 3, 6),
hand-coded generalized Karatsuba multiplication algorithms \cite{someone} will
improve running times.
