\chapter{Bilinear Maps}

Public-key cryptosystems are the most celebrated contribution of modern
cryptography, thanks to their revolutionary impact on key distribution. All
such cryptosystems in wide use today can trace their roots to the
Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol~\cite{diffie76new} or the RSA
cryptosystem~\cite{RSA}. The former depends on cyclic groups with particular
properties. The latter, though using similar arithmetic operations, relies on
different principles: RSA uses groups that are not cyclic and requires that the
order of the group to be kept secret.

Roughly speaking, bilinear maps, or pairings, add extra features to cyclic
groups. These additional properties were initially seen as detrimental since
they could be exploited to break cryptosystems~\cite{mov, fr, fmr}, but it was
later discovered that they could also be exploited to build cryptosystems.
Rather than avoiding pairings, one can seek them out to construct new schemes.

Perhaps the most famous early example, though not the first ~\cite{sok, j}, is
a scheme due to Boneh and Franklin. Since its proposal by Shamir in
1984~\cite{shamir1984}, researchers were unable to build a practical
identity-based encryption scheme by conventional means for approximately twenty
years until Boneh and Franklin found an elegant solution using bilinear
maps~\cite{bf}.

Extending the basic idea leads to other identity-based schemes such as
authenticated or hierarchical identity-based encryption~\cite{l, hl}.
Researchers rapidly discovered many more cryptographic applications of the
pairing, giving birth to a new field: pairing-based
cryptography~\cite{thelounge}.

Interestingly, an identity-based cryptosystem based on quadratic residues and
not bilinear maps was later proposed~\cite{cocks01, bgh}, albeit one that is
signifcantly less practical. However, this is the exception and not the rule.
In general it is unclear how to find conventional equivalents of a given
pairing-based cryptosystem.

\section{Cyclic Groups}

Let $G = \langle g \rangle$ of prime order $r$. Let $g$ be a generator of $G$
and let $x, y, z$ be integers in $[0, r-1]$. Consider the following problems:

\begin{description}
\item [Discrete Log Problem.]
Given $g, g^x$, compute $x$.
\item [Computational Diffie-Hellman Problem.]
Given $g, g^x, g^y$, compute $g^{x y}$.
\item [Decisional Diffie-Hellman Problem.]
Given $g, g^x, g^y, g^z$, determine if $x y = z$.
\end{description}

Observe if we could solve the discrete log problem then we could solve
the other problems.

We can build a vast array of cryptosystems, such as the Diffie-Hellman key
exchange protocol, by assuming these problems or variantions on them are
difficult to solve.

\section{Formal Security Definitions}

For completeness we clearly define what it means for a problem to be
difficult. This material can be skipped as we shall omit security proofs: our
focus is on the implementation of pairing-based cryptosystems, not their
correctness.

We present two flavours of definitions: asymptotic, and
fixed-security-parameter. We first describe the asymptotic definition,
which mathematically states that a problem is hard if no efficient algorithm
can solve it.

We say a function $f:\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$
is negligible if for all $c > 0$ there exists a $\lambda_0 > 0$ such that
for all $\lambda \ge \lambda_0$, $f(\lambda) < 1 / \lambda^c$.
Intuitively a function is negligible if it is smaller than any polynomial
function for sufficiently large inputs. Examples of negligible functions
are $2^{-\lambda}$ and $\lambda^{-\log\lambda}$, while $\lambda^{-10000000}$
is nonnegligible.

Let $\mathcal G = \{G_1, G_2, ... \}$ be a family of cyclic groups
where the order of $G_i$ is an $i$-bit number.
For an algorithm $A$
define the \emph{advantage} of $A$ to be
\[
Adv_A(t) = \Pr [ A(g, g^x) = x ]
\]
is negligible,
where $g$ is randomly chosen (uniformly) from $G_t$ and $x$ from
$[0, |G_t|-1]$.

Then we say that the discrete log problem is hard in $\mathcal G$ if $Adv_A$ is
negligible for all probabilistic expected polynomial-time algorithms $A$.

Decisional variants of problems must be handled differently.
For example, we say the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem is hard if
for all probabilistic expected polynomial-time algorithms $A$
\[
Adv_A(t) = | \Pr [ A(g, g^x, g^y, g^z) = B(x, y, z) ] - 1/2 |
\]
is negligible,
where $g$ is randomly chosen from $G_t$, $x, y$ from $[0,r-1]$, and
$z$ from $[0,r-1]$ with probability 1/2 and set to $x y$ otherwise,
and where $B$ returns 1 if $x y = z$ and 0 otherwise.

The other flavour, the fixed-security-parameter definition, is couched
explicitly in terms of running times and probabilities, and is typically used
with problems whose inputs have a fixed size. A classic example is breaking the
DES cipher: defining the difficulty of this problem asymptotically is
nonsensical since DES keys are always 56 bits long.

When using fixed security parameters, we say the discrete
log problem is $(t, \varepsilon)$-hard in a given
group $G$ if for all probabilistic $t$-time algorithms $A$ we have
\[ \Pr [ A(g, g^x) = x ] < \varepsilon \]
where $g$ is uniformly chosen from $G$ and $x$ from $[0, |G| -1]$.
The security definitions for other problems in either flavour
are similarly constructed and are left as an exercise.

For a cyclic group to be cryptographically useful, we typically require the
discrete log or related problem to be hard. We also require other problems to
be easy, namely we must have efficient algorithms for multiplying group
elements, inverting group elements, and hashing to a group element. Observe
this implies efficient exponentiation and random element selection, as
exponentiation can be performed via repeated squaring, and we can obtain a
random element of a cyclic group by exponentiating a generator by a randomly
chosen integer. With pairing-based cryptography, computing a bilinear map must
also be efficient.

For asymptotic definitions, we formally define ``efficient'' to mean polynomial
expected running time, but in the fixed-security-parameter world, and also in
practice, we loosely say an operation in a deployed cryptosystem is
``efficient'' if its latency is small enough that the user experience is
satisfactory.

\section{Concrete Cyclic Groups}

There are two mathematical settings to choose from
when implementing cyclic groups: finite fields and elliptic curves.
We give a short summary here and will expound on elliptic curves later.

For finite fields, one picks a prime $n$ and uses
a subgroup $G$ of $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$
of prime order $r$, so the group operation is field multiplication.
Note an RSA cryptosystem arises when $n$ is instead chosen to be the
product of two
large primes $P$, $Q$, in which case computations are still possible
in $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$ even if its order is unknown.

For elliptic curves, one takes an elliptic curve $E$ over some
finite field $K$ and takes some subgroup $G$ of the group of points
$E(K)$ with prime order $r$, so the group operation is point addition.
There is no elliptic curve version of RSA, but we shall encounter
a case which may seem confusingly similar to RSA: we sometimes choose
a curve whose group of points has order $n = PQ$.

Historically, finite fields were proposed first, and much has been published on
implementing finite fields as well as their potential weaknesses. Of particular
interest are subexponential discrete log algorithms such as index calculus.
To defeat them, finite field sizes be at least 1024 bits.

Elliptic curves were proposed later, and their use in cryptography was
initially viewed as experimental and potentially unsound. They are now much
less controversial thanks to the efforts of many researchers. A myriad of
optimizations and algorithms were discovered for elliptic curve cryptography,
and encouragingly, a specialized elliptic curve discrete log algorithm has yet
to be found. In other words, the fastest known method to break discrete log for
a general elliptic curve is to use one of the best algorithms for generic
cyclic groups, such as the Pollard rho and lambda methods. This implies the
security of a 160-bit elliptic curve group and a 1024-bit finite field are
roughly equivalent.

Thus currently elliptic curves present many advantages over finite fields.
Despite more complex algorithms for basic operations, they are much faster
and more compact due to a smaller group size.

In Section~\ref{sec:singular} we find that
finite fields can be viewed as a special case of elliptic
curves due to a correspondence between certain singular curves and
multiplicative groups of finite fields.

\section{\label{sec:symmetricpairing}The Symmetric Pairing}

We begin with the original and simplest abstract definition of the pairing.
Let $G, G_T$ be cyclic groups of prime order $r$.
Let $g$ be a generator of $G$.
A \emph{bilinear pairing} or \emph{bilinear map}
$e$ is an efficiently computable function
\[
e:G \times G \rightarrow G_T
\]
such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\emph{(Nondegeneracy)}
$e(g,g) \ne 1$
\item
\emph{(Bilinearity)}
$e(g^a, g^b) = e(g,g)^{a b}$ for all $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$
\end{enumerate}

A symmetric bilinear map is completely defined by the value it
takes at $e(g,g)$. Essentially there is always exactly one bilinear map
for any given cyclic group:
we have the degenerate case when $e(g,g)=1$
while the other $r-1$ maps are
equivalent up to a constant,
in the sense that if $e_1, e_2$ are nondegenerate bilinear maps then for
some constant $c$ we have
then $e_1(g,h) = e_2(g,h)^c$ for all $g,h \in G$.
Hence we can always find a bilinear map for any cyclic group;
the difficulty lies in finding an efficiently computable bilinear map.

We can immediately demonstrate power of such a map. Given
$g, g^x, g^y, g^z$, by bilinearity and nondegeneracy,
$z = x y$ if and only if
$e(g, g^z) = e(g^x, g^y)$. In other words we can solve the decisional
Diffie-Hellman problem. Thus cryptosystems relying on the intractability of
this problem cannot be constructed on a cyclic group with a symmetric pairing,
though later we present a more general pairing definition where DDH can still
be difficult despite the presence of a bilinear map.

Note it is not known how to solve the computational Diffie-Hellman
or discrete log problem using a pairing.

\section{The BLS Signature Scheme}

With the abstract definition and some assumptions, we can readily construct
cryptosystems. We have just noted that if cyclic group with such a bilinear map
exists, then we have a group where the computational Diffie-Hellman problem is
thought to be hard, yet the decisional variant is easy to solve. Such groups
are sometimes called Gap Diffie-Hellman groups~\cite{op}, and imply a signature
scheme, often referred to as the BLS Signature Scheme~\cite{bls}:

\begin{description}
\item[Setup.]
Choose a Gap Diffie-Hellman group $G$ of prime order $r$.
Publish a generator $g \in G$.

\item[Key Generation.]
Choose a random $x$ in $\{1,...,r-1\}$. Output
the public key $g^x$ and the private key $x$.

\item[Signing.]
Given a message $h \in G$, output $h^x$.

\item[Verify.]
Given a message-signature pair $h, \sigma$ and public key $g^x$,
check that $\langle{ g, h, g^x, \sigma}\rangle$ is a Diffie-Hellman tuple.
\end{description}

It can be shown that under the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption, this
signature scheme is secure against existential forgery under a chosen-message
attack in the random oracle model \cite{bls}.

Hence an abstract view of the pairing is all that is needed to build a
cryptosystem, and frequently this suffices. However, we shall find it is better
to possess a deeper understanding of pairings. For example, we need to know
more to show the above signature scheme is short in length, which was the
original motivation for its proposal.

This signature scheme has other useful properties, including batched
verification and allowing the the simple construction of aggregate, ring and
verifiably-encrypted signatures\cite{bgls}.

\section{New Hardness Assumptions}

Classic problems have natural counterparts in pairing-based
cryptography. In the examples below, let $g$ be a generator
for a group $G$ of prime order $r$, and let $e$ be a bilinear map
on $G$.

\begin{description}
\item [Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Problem~\cite{bf}.]
Given $g,g^x,g^y,g^z$ compute $e(g,g)^{xyz}$. This assumption
was implicitly used before it was formally defined~\cite{sok, j}.
\item [Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Problem~\cite{bbibe}.]
Given $g,g^x,g^y,g^z,e(g,g)^w$, determine if $w = x y z$.
This has also been referred to as BDDH~\cite{bf}.
\item [$q$-Strong Diffie-Hellman Problem~\cite{bbshort}.]
Given $g,g^x,...,g^{(x^q)}$, compute $c, g^{1/(x_c)}$
for any $c\in\{1,...,r-1\}$.
\end{description}

Recall if we can solve the discrete log problem, then we can also solve
the computational and decisional Diffie-Hellman problems. Similarly,
security reductions exist amongst these new problems~\cite{jouxsurvey}.

The BLS signature scheme does not use any of these new assumptions, and merely
employs the pairing to solve the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem. In
contrast, other pairing-based cryptosystems such as the identity-based
encryption scheme of Boneh and Franklin~\cite{bf} do rely on the hardness of
one or more problems involving pairings.

Sometimes a conventional cryptosystem suggests a pairing-based counterpart. For
example, the above pairing-based signature scheme and a ring signature scheme
due to Rivest et al.~\cite{rst} were presented in adjacent sessions at a
conference. Someone taking the ideas from both talks would not have much
difficulty in synthesizing their results. Indeed, a pairing-based ring
signature scheme was presented about one year later~\cite{bgls}.

As before, we can readily construct both asymptotic and
fixed-security-parameter formal security definitions for each of the above
problems.

\section{\label{sec:asymmetricpairing}Loosening the Pairing Definition}

In practice, symmetric pairings can be instantiated by using suitable
supersingular elliptic curves. However, in order to allow a wider range of
curves to be used, we must modify the definition. One early pairing-based
cryptography publication by Boneh, Lynn and Shacham suggested the
following~\cite{bls}, sometimes called the \emph{asymmetric pairing}.

Let $G_1, G_2, G_T$ be cyclic groups of prime order $r$.
Assume the Diffie-Hellman problem is hard in $G_1$.
Let $\phi : G_2 \rightarrow G_1$ be an efficiently computable group
isomorphism. Let $g_2$ be a generator of $G_2$.
Set $g_1 = \phi(g_2)$ (so $g_1$ generates $G_1$). 
A bilinear pairing $e$ is an efficiently computable function
\[
e:G_1 \times G_2 \rightarrow G_T
\]
such that $e(g_1,g_2) \ne 1$ and
$e(g_1^a, g_2^b) = e(g_1,g_2)^{a b}$ for all $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$.

This definition allows a greater variety of pairings to be used,
notably those constructed on ordinary curves.
Additionally, because of the map $\phi$, security proofs
require only minimal changes. For example,
a scheme based on the CDH assumption in $G$ under
the symmetric pairing definition may now be based on the CDH assumption in
$G_2$.

However, it is advantageous to further loosen the definition.

\subsection{A Problem With Hashing}

Suppose we have chosen an ordinary curve that does not yield a symmetric
pairing, and suppose that we wish to redesign the cryptosystem to instead use
an asymmetric pairing defined above.

It turns out that there is no known method to hash to an element of $G_2$ such
that its discrete log to some fixed base is unknown. We can hash to elements of
$G_1$ and $G_T$, and perform all other cryptographically useful operations in
$G_2$ such as picking a random element, multiplication and inversion. We can
map an element of $G_2$ to $G_1$. We just cannot hash a string to an element of
$G_2$.

For some cryptosystems, this issue can complicate their design, and in extreme
cases we may have to give up and stick to symmetric pairings only. However,
with a more general pairing definition, we can use ordinary curves and still be
able to hash to $G_2$.

\section{\label{sec:generalpairing}The General Bilinear Pairing}

To enable certain optimizations (see Section~\ref{sec:denomelim}) and
to permit hashing to any element of any group including $G_2$,
we prefer the following definition. Additionally, its more flexible nature
allows a greater number of assumptions which in turn allow more
cryptosystems to be built.

Let $r$ be a prime.
Let $G_1, G_T$ be cyclic groups of order $r$.
Let $G_2$ be a group where each element has order dividing $r$.
In particular $G_2$ is not necessarily cyclic.
Again we use multiplicative group notation.
A bilinear pairing $e$ is an efficiently computable function
\[
e:G_1 \times G_2 \rightarrow G_T
\]
such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\emph{(Nondegeneracy)}
$e(g_1,g_2) = 1_{G_T}$ for all $g_2 \in G_2$ if and only if $g_1 = 1_{G_1}$,
and similarly 
$e(g_1,g_2) = 1_{G_T}$ for all $g_1 \in G_1$ if and only if $g_2 = 1_{G_2}$.
\item
\emph{(Bilinearity)}
for all $g_1 \in G_1$ and $g_2 \in G_2$:
$e(g_1^a, g_2^b) = e(g_1,g_2)^{a b}$ for all $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$
\end{enumerate}

In this setting the hardness assumptions must be altered further. Depending on
the scheme, we may have to assume certain problems are hard in both $G_1$ and
$G_2$, or a combination of the two. For example, we may need to assume that
given $g_1, g_1^x \in G_1$ and $g_2 \in G_2$, there is no efficient algorithm
to compute $g_2^x$. This last example is sometimes referred to as the
computational co-Diffie-Hellman assumption~\cite{bls}.

This definition also allows assumptions that were previously impossible. For
example, some schemes such as the group signature scheme of Boneh, Boyen and
Shacham~\cite{bbs} require discrete log, CDH and co-CDH to be hard in $G_1,
G_2$ and also DDH to be hard in $G_1$. Other cryptosystems still require in
addition DDH to be hard in $G_2$, require $G_2$ to be cyclic, or require an
efficiently computable group isomorphism $\phi:G_2 \rightarrow G_1$, all of
which are variations on this formal definition, and in
Section~\ref{sec:twistcurvetradeoffs} we learn how to construct pairings for
each case.

We have not required $r$ to be prime. A composite group order is useful for
some cryptosystems~\cite{bgn}, but we must be aware that in this case even if
$g_1$ and $g_2$ have order $r$, $e(g_1, g_2)$ may not be a generator of $G_T$,
but rather a generator of some subgroup of $G_T$ whose order is a factor of
$r$.

When $r$ is composite, it is incorrect to say all nondegenerate pairings are
equivalent up to a constant. Indeed, if $d > 1$ is a divisor of $r$
and $g_1, g_2$ are generators of $G_1, G_2$ respectively, then a bilinear map
that takes $(g_1, g_2)$ to a $d$th root of unity is still nondegenerate.
Since there is more than one choice for $d$ for a composite $r$,
these maps cannot be equivalent up to a constant. They are however still
completely determined by $e(g_1, g_2)$ where $g_1, g_2$ are generators.
We present a concrete example later in Section~\ref{sec:compositeexample}.

This also means that $e(g_1, g_2) = 1$ does not imply at least
one of $g_1, g_2$ is the identity element, in contrast to the case when
$r$ is prime. When $r$ is composite, we must be careful to avoid
making statements about the pairing only true for prime $r$.
We shall encounter a concrete example later.

Note when $r$ is chosen to be a product of two primes, the resulting scheme
is substantially different to RSA as the groups are cyclic and of
known order.

\section{Exponentiation as a Bilinear Pairing}

Given some integer $r > 1,$
let us take $G_1 = G_T = \mathbb{Z}_r^*$ and $G_2 = \mathbb{Z}_{r-1}^+$.
Define $e:G_1\times G_2 \rightarrow G_T$ by $e(g, a)= g^a$.

If we relax the condition that the groups are cyclic, then exponentiation
satisfies the definition of a bilinear pairing. Thus we may view all discrete
log and RSA cryptosystems as pairing-based cryptosystems, though with
significant differences. For example, the discrete log problem
is easy in $G_2$, and $G_1 = G_T$.

Classic problems can be restated in terms of pairings. For example:

\begin{description}
\item[Discrete Log Problem.]
Given $g \in G_1, c \in G_T$, find $a \in G_2$ such that $e(g,a) = c$.
\item[RSA Problem.]
Given $a \in G_2, c \in G_T$, find $g \in G_1$ with
$e(g,a) = c$.
\item[Strong RSA Problem.]
Given $c \in G_T$, find $g \in G_1, a\in G_2$ with
$e(g,a) = c$.
\end{description}

Thinking of conventional cryptosystems as pairing-based cryptosystems can
inspire new ideas.

\section{Choosing a Definition}

The symmetric pairing with cyclic groups into which strings can be hashed
allows simpler and briefer mathematical statements and definitions.
Additionally, the symmetry can be helpful. However, there are few families of
elliptic curves that allow such a pairing.

In practice, one can usually trivially modify schemes originally built with
symmetric pairings to use a more general pairing definition, so that more
families of curves can be used. This may require modifications of various
assumptions and security proofs . For example, we might replace the the
Computation Diffie-Hellman assumption with the co-Computation Diffie-Hellman
problem. Or perhaps a minor reworking allows the cryptosystem to function when
$G_2$ is not cyclic.

Ideally a cryptosystem should use the most general definition when first
proposed, allowing maximum choice for the pairing in an implementation. If a
more restrictive definition is necessary, one must pick the extra assumptions
carefully and be aware that perhaps only a few pairing families may satisfy
them. For example, there is no known pairing such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item Both input groups $G_1, G_2$ are cyclic.
\item One can hash strings to $G_1$ and $G_2$ without knowing the
discrete log of the output to some fixed base.
\item There is an efficiently computable isomorphism $\phi:G_2\rightarrow G_1$
whose inverse is difficult to compute.
\end{enumerate}
yet we can find pairings that satisfy any two of the three conditions.

Familiarizing oneself with the mathematics behind pairings has several
advantages over merely memorizing their properties and common assumptions.
Ignorance of the inner workings could result in stipulating conditions for
which no pairing exists. For instance, it is far from obvious that
we can only stipulate up to two of the three conditions in the above list.
Knowledge of the computations being performed also enables us to estimate the
time and space taken by cryptographic operations, which is affected by the
pairing choice in subtle ways. For example, if we use a symmetric pairing, then
typically elements will be 512 bits long. If we forgo symmetry and use two
groups $G_1, G_2$, then it turns out we may achieve a 160-bit $G_1$ and a
320-bit $G_2$ if we are willing to sacrifice speed.

\section{Concrete Bilinear Maps}

There is only one known setting for cryptographically useful bilinear maps,
namely elliptic curves with an efficiently computable Tate pairing.
Strictly speaking, much of the theory in fact generalizes to hyperelliptic
curves~\cite{galbraith,rubinsilverberg,freemanhyper}. Although hyperelliptic
curve cryptography appears to be a promising avenue for future research, there
are no compelling reasons to use them. To the author's knowledge, there are
no implementations of pairing-based cryptosystems based on hyperelliptic
curves. Thus we ignore hyperelliptic curves, so $G$, or $G_1$ and $G_2$ are
always groups of points on an elliptic curve, and $G_T$ is always a subgroup of
a multiplicative group of a finite field.

Mathematicians have traditionally employed additive notation for the group of
points on an elliptic curve, since it is Abelian. As a result, publications in
the area often use additive group notation along with uppercase letters for
elements for the input groups.

We have used multiplicative notation in this chapter to highlight the
Diffie-Hellman heritage of pairing-based cryptography. This notation also
suggests the right way to compare elliptic curve and finite field operations:
point multiplications should be compared with exponentiations, not integer
multiplications. We later switch to additive notation when discussing the
underlying mathematics.

When deploying a pairing-based cryptosystem one must select a type of curve to
use. The correct choice depends on several factors, which we discuss in later
chapters.

We conclude with a toy example of the BLS signature scheme.
Let $q = 427211363219$.
Consider the curve $E : y^2 = x^3 + x$ over
$\Fq$. Then $E(\Fq)$ contains a subgroup
$G$ of order $r = 524353$ (which is a prime factor of $427211363219 + 1$).
Take a random generator
\[ g = (359473638793, 293998693014) \]
for the system parameter, and a random secret key
\[ x = 66995 . \]
Then the corresponding public key is
\[ g^x = (166505572345, 357692656519) . \]
Suppose a message hashes to
\[ h = (370499138522, 78458612837) . \]
Then the corresponding signature is
\[ \sigma = h^x = (278647014375, 78919786700) . \]
To verify, we must check that $e(g, \sigma) = e(g^x , h)$.
In my test program, both sides are equal to
\[ 85791756805 + 99975533880i , \]
an element of $K[i]$ that has order $r$.
The exact value varies from implementation to implementation since the pairing
is only unique up to a constant. Different implementations may give different
results, but both sides of the equation always match, and are equal to an
element of order $r$.

The order $r$ in the above example is roughly 20 bits in length, while the
order $q$ of the field, and the space required by compressed elements of $G_1$
and $G_2$ is roughly 40 bits. Typically we require a 160-bit $r$ and 512-bit
$q$ for secure signatures.
