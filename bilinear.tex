\chapter{Bilinear Maps}

Asymmetric ciphers, or public-key cryptosystems are perhaps
the most celebrated contribution of modern cryptography.
They certainly have had the most impact. It is hard to imagine
what the world would be like without their revolutionary
approach to key distribution.

All public-key cryptosystems in wide use today can trace their
roots to the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol \cite{diffie76new}
or the RSA cryptosystem \cite{RSA}.
The former depends on cyclic groups of prime order
with particular properties. (The latter, although similar, differs
substantially. For example, RSA uses groups that
are not cyclic and requires that the order of the group to be unknown
to the attacker.)

Roughly speaking, bilinear maps, also called pairings,
give some of these cyclic groups additional properties.
Initially, in the 1990s,
these additional properties were seen as detrimental
as they could be exploited to break cryptosystems \cite{mov, fr, fmr}.
but it was later found that they can also be exploited to build cryptosystems.
Rather than avoiding such groups, one can use them to construct new
cryptosystems, giving rise to pairing-based cryptography.

Boneh and Franklin's identity-based encryption \cite{bf} scheme was perhaps
the most famous early example of what could be achieved using
bilinear maps, though not the first \cite{sok, j}.
Propsed in 1984 \cite{shamir1984},
researchers were unable to build such a cryptosystem by
conventional means for approximately
twenty years. 
With bilinear maps, a relatively straightforward scheme
was found \cite{bf}. With a little more work, identity-based schemes
with additional useful properties (such as authenticated or hierarchical
identity-based encryption) can be constructed.

We note that a
scheme based on quadratic residues that does not require bilinear maps
has since been discovered \cite{cocks01}, albeit one that is signifcantly
less practical.
However, many of the other new systems may not exist without pairings,
as it is not known how to build them using conventional means.

\section{Cyclic Groups}

Let $G = \langle g \rangle$ of prime order $r$.
Let $g, h$ be generators of $G$
and let $x, y, z$ be integers in $[0, r-1]$.
Consider the following problems.

\begin{description}
\item [Discrete Log Problem.]
Given $g, g^x$, compute $x$.
\item [Computational Diffie-Hellman Problem.]
Given $g, g^x, g^y$, compute $g^{x y}$.
\item [Decisional Diffie-Hellman Problem.]
Given $g, g^x, g^y, g^z$, determine if $x y = z$.
\end{description}

A vast array of cryptosystems including the Diffie-Hellman key
exchange protocol can be built assuming one of these problems
is difficult to solve.

TODO: formal defn of hard:
efficient inverse, multiply, random, hash, etc.

\section{Concrete Cyclic Groups}

There are two mathematical settings to choose from
when implementing cyclic groups: finite fields and elliptic curves.

For finite fields, one
chooses a prime $n$ and uses
a subgroup $G$ of $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$
of prime order $r$, so the group operation is field multiplication.

An RSA cryptosystem arises when $n$ is instead chosen to be the product of two
large primes $P$, $Q$, in which case computations are still possible
in $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$ even if its order is unknown.

For elliptic curves, one takes an elliptic curve $E$ over some
finite field $K$ and takes some subgroup $G$ of the group of points
$E(K)$ with prime order $r$, so the group operation is point addition.

There is no ellitpic curve version of RSA. However, we shall encounter
a case which may be confusingly similar to RSA: when a curve is
chosen such that its group of points has order $n = PQ$.

Finite fields were proposed first, and as a result, much research has
been performed on implementing finite fields and potential weaknesses.
Of particular note is the discovery of subexponential discrete log
algorithms such as index calculus, resulting in recommendations that
field sizes be at least 1024 bits.

Elliptic curves were investigated later, and their use in cryptography
was at first viewed as experimental. However, they are now much less
controversial thanks to the efforts of many researchers. Many optimizations
and algorithms were discovered for elliptic curve cryptography,
and encouringly, no specialized elliptic curve discrete log algorithm
has been found, that is, the fastest known way to break discrete log
for a general elliptic curve is to use a algorithm for a generic
cyclic group (such as Pollard rho, or lambda) implying that a group
size of 160 bits is roughly equivalent to 1024-bit finite field security.
TODO: cite?

Thus currently elliptic curves present many advantages over finite fields.
Despite more complex algorithms for basic operations, they are much faster
and more compact due to a smaller group size.

We note that finite fields can be viewed as a special case of elliptic
curves due to a correspondence between certain singular curves and
multipicative groups of finite fields.

\section{Bilinear Maps}

We shall begin with the original and simplest definition of the pairing.

\section{The Symmetric Pairing}

Let $G, G_T$ be cyclic groups of prime order $r$.
Let $g$ be a generator of $G$.
A \emph{bilinear pairing} or \emph{bilinear map}
$e$ is an efficiently computable function
\[
e:G \times G \rightarrow G_T
\]
such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\emph{(Nondegeneracy)}
$e(g,g) \ne 1$
\item
\emph{(Bilinearity)}
$e(g^a, g^b) = e(g,g)^{a b}$ for all $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$
\end{enumerate}

Note a symmetric bilinear map is completely defined by the value it
takes at $e(g,g)$. Thus there always exist $r$ bilinear maps: if
$e(g,g)=1$ then we have the degenerate case and the other $r-1$ maps are
equivalent up to a constant,
in the sense that if $e_1(g,g) = g_1$ and $e_2(g,g) = g_2$
then $e_2 = g_1^{-1} g_2 e_1$. The difficulty is in finding such a map
that is efficiently computable.

We can immediately see the power of such a map: given
$g, g^x, g^y, g^z$, then by bilinearity and nondegeneracy,
$z = x y$ if and only if
$e(g, g^z) = e(g^x, g^y)$. In other words we can solve the Decisional
Diffie-Hellman problem.

However, it is not known how to solve the Computational Diffie-Hellman
or discrete log problem using a pairing.

\section{A Signature Scheme}

Thus we can construct a cyclic group where the Computational Diffie-Hellman
problem is thought to be hard, yet the Decisional variant is easy to solve.
Such groups have been named Gap Diffie-Hellman groups\cite{bls} and
imply a signature scheme:

\begin{description}
\item[Setup.]
Choose a Gap Diffie-Hellman group $G$ of prime order $r$.
Publish a generator $g \in G$.

\item[Key Generation.]
Choose a random $x$ in $\{1,...,r-1\}$. Output
the public key $g^x$ and the private key $x$.

\item[Signing.]
Given a message $h \in G$, output $h^x$.

\item[Verify.]
Given a message-signature pair $h, \sigma$ and public key $g^x$,
check that $\langle{ g, h, g^x, \sigma}\rangle$ is a Diffie-Hellman tuple.
\end{description}

It can be shown that this signature scheme is secure against existential
forgery under a chosen-message attack in the random oracle model \cite{bls}.

Hence an abstract view of the pairing is all that is needed to build a
cryptosystem, and frequently this suffices. However,
we shall see that it can be useful to understand pairings in more detail.
For example, we need more facts to show the above signature scheme is
short, which was initially the reason it was proposed.

\section{New Hardness Assumptions}

Classic problems have natural counterparts in pairing-based
cryptography. In the examples below, let $g$ be a generator
for a group $G$ of prime order $r$, and let $e$ be a bilinear map
on $G$.

\begin{description}
\item [Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Problem.]
Given $g,g^x,g^y,g^z$ compute $e(g,g)^{xyz}$
\item [Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Problem.]
Given $g,g^x,g^y,g^z,e(g,g)^w$, determine if $w = x y z$.
\item [$q$-Strong Diffie-Hellman Problem.]
Given $g,g^x,...,g^{(x^q)}$, compute $c, g^{1/(x_c)}$
for any $c\in\{1,...,r-1\}$.
\end{description}

TODO: Reductions between them

Various cryptosystems rely on one or more of the above problems to be
hard.

Similarly, sometimes it is easy to convert a conventional cryptosystem
into a pairing-based cryptosystem. For example,
the above pairing-based signature scheme and a ring signature scheme
due to Rivest et al. \cite{rst} were presented in adjacent sessions
at a conference. Someone who attended both talks would not have much
difficulty in synthesizing the two ideas together. Indeed,
a pairing-based ring signature scheme was presented about one
year later\cite{bls2}.

\section{Pairings Redefined}

In practice, symmetric pairings can be instantiated by
using suitable supersingular elliptic curves.
However, in order to allow a wider range of curves to be used,
the definition can be modified as follows, sometimes referred
to as the asymmetric pairing.

Let $G_1, G_2, G_T$ be cyclic groups of prime order $r$.
Assume the Diffie-Hellman problem is hard in $G_1$.
Let $\phi : G_2 \rightarrow G_1$ be an efficiently computable group
isomorphism. Let $g_2$ be a generator of $G_2$.
Set $g_1 = \phi(g_2)$ (so $g_1$ generates $G_1$). 
A bilinear pairing $e$ is an efficiently computable function
\[
e:G_1 \times G_2 \rightarrow G_T
\]
such that $e(g_1,g_2) \ne 1$ and
$e(g_1^a, g_2^b) = e(g_1,g_2)^{a b}$ for all $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Note if a problem is hard $G_1$, it is also hard in $G_2$
due to existence of an efficiently computable
$\phi$.

This definition appears in the literature, but it is advantageous
to modify it further.

\section{The General Bilinear Pairing}

To allow some optimizations on bilinear maps,
we use the following definition.

Let $r$ be a prime.
Let $G_1, G_T$ be cyclic groups of order $r$.
Let $G_2$ be a group where each element except the identity has order $r$.
Again we use multiplicative group notation.
A bilinear pairing $e$ is an efficiently computable function
\[
e:G_1 \times G_2 \rightarrow G_T
\]
such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\emph{(Nondegeneracy)}
$e(g_1,g_2) = 1_{G_T}$ for all $g_2 \in G_2$ if and only if $g_1 = 1_{G_1}$,
and similarly 
$e(g_1,g_2) = 1_{G_T}$ for all $g_1 \in G_1$ if and only if $g_2 = 1_{G_2}$.
\item
\emph{(Bilinearity)}
for all $g_1 \in G_1$ and $g_2 \in G_2$:
$e(g_1^a, g_2^b) = e(g_1,g_2)^{a b}$ for all $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$
\end{enumerate}

In this setting the hardness assumptions must be altered further.
Depending on the scheme, we may have to assume certain problems are hard in
both $G_1$ and $G_2$, or a combination of the two. For example, we may
need to assume that given $g_1, g_1^x \in G_1$ and $g_2 \in G_2$,
there is no efficient algorithm to compute $g_2^x$. This particular
example is sometimes referred to as
the co-Computational Diffie-Hellman assumption.

We have not required $r$ to be prime. A composite group
order is useful for some cryptosystems\cite{bgn},
but we must be aware that in this case even if $g_1$ and $g_2$ have order
$r$, $e(g_1, g_2)$ may not be a generator of $G_T$, but rather a generator
of some subgroup of $G_T$ whose order is a factor of $r$.

TODO: not quite RSA?

\section{Exponentiation as a Bilinear Pairing}

Given some integer $r > 1,$
let us take $G_1 = G_T = \mathbb{Z}_r^*$ and $G_2 = \mathbb{Z}_{r-1}^+$.
Define $e:G_1\times G_2 \rightarrow G_T$ by $e(g, a)= g^a$.

Then it is easily seen that exponentiation in a cyclic group satisfies
the definition of a bilinear
pairing. Thus we may view all discrete log and RSA cryptosystems
as pairing-based cryptosystems, though there are significant differences
in this setting. For example, the discrete log problem is easy
in $G_2$ and $G_1 = G_T$.

Classic problems can be restated in terms of
pairings. For example:

\begin{description}
\item[Discrete Log Problem.]
Given $g \in G_1, c \in G_T$, find $a \in G_2$ such that $e(g,a) = c$.
\item[RSA Problem.]
Given $a \in G_2, c \in G_T$, find $g \in G_1$ with
$e(g,a) = c$
\item[Strong RSA Problem.]
Given $c \in G_T$, find $g \in G_1, a\in G_2$ with
$e(g,a) = c$
\end{description}

TODO: can build pairing schemes using same assumptions?

\section{Choosing a Definition}

Many cryptosystems designed under the original version of the pairing can
be trivially modified so that they remain secure under the revised
definition, possibly assuming different problems are difficult.
Those that cannot be modified have a limited selection of pairings.

We shall see there are other subtle caveats.
For example, suppose a design goal of a cryptosystem is to minimize the
number of bits needed to represent a group element. If we use
a symmetric pairing, then in typical use, elements will be 512 bits long.
If we forgo symmetry and use two groups $G_1, G_2$,
then it turns out we can find a 160-bit $G_1$ and a 320-bit $G_2$.
